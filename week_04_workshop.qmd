# Introduction to the dataset

The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It
examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis
patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).

```{python}
#load the dataset

tb_data = pd.read_csv("/Users/Federica/Desktop/Graph course python/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv")

itab.show(tb_data)
```

Vellore district is situated in the North-East of the Tamil Nadu region in India.

# Male patients and female patients' age distribution

```{python}
#create overlaid histogram of age and sex

tb_data_age_sex = px.histogram(tb_data, x="Age", color="Sex", barmode="overlay", title = "Age distribution by sex")

tb_data_age_sex.show()

```

In the dataset there are more male patients than female ones. Addionally, male patients are on average older than female patients, as the age categories with the highest count sit more on the right side of the graph.

```{python}
tb = pd.DataFrame(tb_data)

max_age = int(tb["Age"].max())

min_age = int(tb["Age"].min())

```

The oldest patient recorded in the dataset is `{python} max_age` years old. The youngest patient is `{python} min_age` years old.
